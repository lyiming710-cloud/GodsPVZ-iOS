# GodsPVZ iOS recovery

Reverse-recovery workspace for the GodsPVZ 1.0.2 Unity IL2CPP builds supplied by the repository owner.

## Confirmed source build

- Unity: `2022.3.44f1c1`
- Android package: `com.tipsGodsStudio.godsPVZ`
- IL2CPP metadata: `31.1`
- Android CodeRegistration: `0x2772B68`
- Android MetadataRegistration: `0x285F870`
- Recovered `Assembly-CSharp.dll`: 2317 MethodDef rows, 2297 methods with CIL bodies, about 1.29 MB of CIL code
- Cpp2IL reported `2319 / 2319` target methods successfully recovered
- 173 serialized game script types have been mapped from AssetRipper `.cs` GUIDs to the recovered Assembly-CSharp managed DLL local file IDs

## Exact Unity package versions recovered from embedded build paths

- `com.unity.ugui@1.0.0`
- `com.unity.textmeshpro@3.0.6`
- `com.unity.render-pipelines.core@14.0.11`
- `com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@14.0.11`
- `com.unity.2d.animation@9.1.1`
- `com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@3.1.2`
- `com.unity.burst@1.8.17`
- `com.unity.collections@1.2.4`
- `com.unity.mathematics@1.2.6`
- `com.unity.visualscripting@1.9.4`

## Current phase

The game assembly is recovered and the Unity resources/scenes have been exported locally. The current task is replacing recovered package-DLL script references with the original Unity package script GUIDs, then running an iOS IL2CPP build. The repository intentionally does not claim a working IPA until the Unity build and device launch are verified.

See `Recovery/STATUS.md` for the detailed recovery state.
